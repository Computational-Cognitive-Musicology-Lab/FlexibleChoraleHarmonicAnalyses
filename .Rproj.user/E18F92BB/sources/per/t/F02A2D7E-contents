#' Features parsed from 572 chorale **kern files, by slice.
#'
#' This dataset contains a large set of useful features parsed

#' J.S. Bach and M. Praetorius, organized by slice (records
#' in the original humdrum files).

#' The dataset contains xx pieces of information about each
#' slice in the data. XX of these pertain to the intire slice---
#' for instance, the beat position. The remaining xx variables
#' actually contain different information for each musical
#' voice in each slice: these are represented as lists of vectors,
#' with the first element in each vector being the xxxest voice (e.g., the bass),
#' and the last being the xxest (e.g., the soprano).
