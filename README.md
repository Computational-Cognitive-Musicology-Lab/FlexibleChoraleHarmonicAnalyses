# FlexibleHarmonicChoraleAnnotations


FlexibleHarmonicChoraleAnnotations is an R package which implements a "flexible" dataset of harmonic analyses of baroque chorale music by J.S. Bach and M. Praetorius.
What makes it "flexible" is that it doesn't just include ONE analysis of the chorales, but a system for generating
countless valid analyses of the chorales, based on constraints you choose.

This package is a companion to the paper <a href="http://ismir2018.ircam.fr/doc/pdfs/283_Paper.pdf"> A Flexible Approach to Automated Harmonic Analysis: Multiple Annotations of Chorales by Back and Praetorius"</a>, 
presented at the International Society of Music Information Retrieval (ISMIR) 2018 conference entitled (Condit-Schultz, Ju, and Fujinaga).

The package requires `R > 3.2` as well as the <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/data.table/index.html">data.table</a>,
 <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/stringr">stringr</a>,
and <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rlang/index.html">rlang</a> packages.


This github page is the development/source code for the package.
A parallel page [here](https://github.com/DDMAL/Flexible_harmonic_chorale_annotations) contains a simple tarball of the package as well as the "raw" chorale kern files,
if you want to access them directly.
